This feature can be installed for Python3 like so:

sudo apt install python3-venv
To make a Python3.9 virtual environment, you would first create a directory and cd to it like so:

mkdir my_env && cd my_env
Then, create a new Python3.9 virtual environment inside the directory like so:

python3.9 -m venv env
To use this environment, activate it like so:

source env/bin/activate
Your shell prompt will show (env) like so:

(env) $
During this, python3 -V will report Python 3.9 and commands, module installs or modifications will be contained locally in this virtual environment.

When you are done, deactivate this Python3.9 virtual environment like so:

deactivate
